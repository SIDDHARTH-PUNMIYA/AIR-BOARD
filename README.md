# AIR-BOARD

THIS IS A PROJECT IN WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO DRAW WITH HAND WITHOUT USING MOUSE LIKE ITS AN AIRCANVAS.

IN THIS PROJECT 
DEPENDANCIES USED:
cv2 and numpy library

ABOUT : 
We have to track our color bead first with the color picker and then put those hsv values in the array in the main file
so the project file will undersand which color is to be tracked. 
Once inserted the contours will be detected and then we can draw easily by the bead stuck to our finger.



Advantages :
Easy to use 
helpful for small kids to draw and teach them as they are not smart enough to use computer

Drawback:
the main flaw is we need to set the hsv values everytime used at a different place as the environment around is changed so we need to again adjust hsv values.
